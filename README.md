### Hi, Iâ€™m Matt Callahan  ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer in Phoenix, Arizona. Computers have been my hobby since my dad bought our first family computer, a 286 IBM PC clone running MS-DOS, 30 years ago. I found [QBasic](https://mfcallahan.com/assets/images/qbasic.png) on that computer and began teaching myself how to program - without Google or StackOverflow! After receiving a [TI-83](https://mfcallahan.com/assets/images/ti83.png) graphing calculator for algebra class in 6th grade, I quickly began making games and homework cheat programs with [TI-BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-BASIC) to share with friends. My interest in programming extended through college, where my Geographic Information Systems major introduced me to Java, Python, and ActionScript + Flash.
